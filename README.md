### :small_blue_diamond: Game Play:
- The user can control the animated bird by pressing spacebar. 
- Long-press will result in a smooth ascending motion, while a tap results in a sharp move. 
- The goal is to fly the bird as far as as possible without hitting an icicle. 

### :small_blue_diamond: Home is 50 score away:

### :small_blue_diamond: Customization:
The difficulty level is adjusted to be fairly high (the factors are: the vertical distance between up and down icicles, the horizontal distance between icicle pairs, and the speed moving forward). 

Find the rhythm, fly to the beats, and have a safe trip! :snowman:
